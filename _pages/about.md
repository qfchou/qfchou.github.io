I am a **third-year Ph.D. student** in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/academics/departments/cse) at [The University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Junzhou Huang](https://ranger.uta.edu/~huang/).  
Before that, I obtained a Bachelor of Applied Bioscience from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

My research interests lie broadly in the following areas:  
- **Multi-modal Learning**, e.g., Multi-modal LLM, Multi-modal Representation Learning, Multi-modal Fusion  
- **Multi-instance Learning**  
- Their applications in **computational pathology**

You can find my CV here: [Qifeng Zhou's CV](../assets/Qifeng_Zhou.pdf)

🚀 I am actively looking for **Summer 2025 internship** and academic collaboration opportunities. Feel free to reach out via email!
