I am a **third-year Ph.D. candidate** in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/academics/departments/cse) at [The University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Junzhou Huang](https://ranger.uta.edu/~huang/).  
Before that, I obtained a Bachelor of Applied Bioscience from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

My research interests lie broadly in the following areas:  
- **Multi-modal Learning**, e.g., Multi-modal LLM, Multi-modal Representation Learning, Multi-modal Fusion  
- **Multi-instance Learning**  
- Their applications in **computational pathology**

You can find my CV here: [Qifeng Zhou's CV](../assets/Qifeng_Zhou.pdf)

ðŸš€ I am actively looking for **Summer 2026 internship** and academic collaboration opportunities. Feel free to reach out via email!

## Experience
- **Digital Pathology Intern** @ **Genmab**
  *Princeton, NJ, USA*
  *Jun. 2025 - Aug. 2025*
  - Engineered an end-to-end multi-modal deep learning framework using **cross-attention** to fuse Whole Slide Images (WSI), omics, and clinical data for patient survival analysis in oncology.
  - Developed a novel deep learning pipeline for non-invasive prediction of **Folate Receptor Alpha (FRÎ±)** expression from H&E pathology images, creating a scalable method for computational biomarker discovery.
  - Managed model development and large-scale data processing in a GPU-enabled cloud environment (AWS, Databricks) utilizing Python and PyTorch.
